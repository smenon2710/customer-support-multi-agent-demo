## 🚀 Quick Start

Running the Project with Docker (Recommended)
This project uses Docker and Docker Compose to build and run all microservices and the Streamlit demo interface easily.

Prerequisites
Install Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine and Docker Compose (Linux)
Ensure Docker daemon is running
Build and Start All Services
From the root of the cloned repository (where your docker-compose.yml file is located), run:
docker compose up --build

This command will:
Build Docker images for each AI agent and the Streamlit demo app
Start containers including Redis as the message queue

Map ports:
Router Agent on localhost:8001
Technical Agent on localhost:8002
Account Agent on localhost:8003
Streamlit Demo Interface on localhost:8501
Access the Demo Interface

Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:8501

Use the interface to submit support tickets and see multi-agent coordination in action.
Stop the System
To stop and remove all containers, run:
docker compose down

Running Locally Without Docker
If you prefer to run services manually on your machine:

1. **Install Dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt


2. **Start All Agents**
Terminal 1: Router Agent
python agents/router_agent/main.py

Terminal 2: Technical Agent
python agents/technical_agent/main.py

Terminal 3: Account Agent
